*** FE approach
frontend visually "queues" a save, waits until the previous save has finished
- would have to write js for this
- this is probably simplest
- can save the previous save time in localstorage so multiple files are ok
- lost on closing page though, which isn't nice

*** queue approach
table:
| neocities_path | str           |
| contents       | str           |
| time           | time          |
| saved_at       | time nullable |

when writing, check for recent saved_at
- if max(saved_at) > 1 minute ago:
  - save immediately, write rows for saved files with saved_at = time
- if max(saved_at) < 1 minute ago:
  - write rows with saved_at as null
  - if task is not kicked off (no null saved_at exists)
    - kick off a task that:
      - checks max(saved_at), then sleeps (1 minute - saved_at)
      - selects all rows with null saved_at and saves them to neocities
        - if there are dupe neocities_paths, use most recent by time

*** slow write endpoint on BE
- just sleeps until it's ready
- still have to keep track of saves
- fe will need to show loading spinner (should probably do this anyway)

** DONE serve empty edit interface to review at /review/edit/<review-slug>
- edit interface should have main review and extra content section?
- extra content can be freeform, gets appended as is to review
** DONE fill edit interface with parsed html values
** DONE set up page for creating a new review on /review
- input and button, creates a new page at /review/<review-slug> but doesn't create it yet
** DONE set up writing to website: review page
** DONE fix edit page actions: preview and edit
** DONE set up writing to website: home page
- parse dates from list endpoint to get most recent ones
- fetch most recent articles, parse, show on main page
*** DONE home page problem: can't get list of all game titles and ratings
- unslugify name to get name
  - what about colons? do something about this? try to get python slugify to treat colons well?
- append random bytes on to page size until its rating is = mod 3
  - then use page size to get rating amount
** DONE prevent saving over a review on /reviews/new
