    "recommendation": "\n          <b><u>no. idk.</u></b> if you can turn your brain off long enough to not think about the sexism, sure, go nuts. i just personally didn't want to deal with it.\n        "

    "review": "that's right everyone, it's <i>alone in the dark</i> again, 2008 PS3 edition. and my opinion on this one is the same as every other one i've seen so far, which is to say ... it's ... a beautiful disaster.\n<p></p>\nthe good news about this particular reboot is that it's lacking the overt objectification &amp; fearmongering of native americans its predecessors had, instead opting to push towards more generic, grotesque, <i>dead space</i>-like monsters, and a well-tread, good-versus-evil, christians-versus-satan style conflict. it's predictable, but it's fine. this game doesn't need a showstopping or unique story to be good, for its charms lie elsewhere: its presentation.\n<p></p>\nyes, indeed, the charm of <i>alone in the dark</i> seems to never be intentional for me. the various minds involved in this game's inception all looked at this prestigious underdog of an IP &amp; thought, \"you know what this franchise needs? another reboot ... but this time, <i>it's like a movie.</i>\" they've implemented new, groudbreaking ideas like ... adding a blinking feature ( to get gunk out of your eye! it's a game you play almost entirely in 3rd person, by the way ) ... or composing a rousing, swelling cinematic OST, which drowns out the dialogue ( no subtitles available ) and frequently feels out of place during gameplay ( heavy auditory drama, next to nothing happening in-game ) ... you know, typical immersive movie stuff.\n<p></p>\nmaybe my favorite new choice, though, is the writing &amp; character work, which is so bad it's funny. carnaby is a quippy, cynical jerk, grizzled with a side of i-don't-give-a-fuck attitude -- your classic asshole male protagonist -- and has given him a female sidekick, who serves exclusively as 1) a love interest with whom carnaby has zero chemistry; 2) a cheerleader, medic, &amp; general support figure; and 3) an object who dies tragically for male tears. combine this with half-baked plot contrivances &amp; poor pacing, and it's just amazing how on the nose everything is, re: being, like, a B-tier action film. it would normally have me rolling my eyes or stomping my feet in rage. but ... there's something about all the pieces of this game coming together that makes it feel less egregious to me, and more comedic. again: not the intention of the developers, i don't think -- it seems they've taken themselves rather seriously with this work.\n<p></p>\nwhen i say \"all the pieces\", i of course mean to include the gameplay, which is critical to making this experience joyful. this game plays very strangely, with a frantic physics system at the core of its unusual gameplay -- lift bodies &amp; items, ignite things on fire &amp; carry them elsewhere, bounce objects &amp; shoot them to solve puzzles, climb dangling ropes, and more -- all of which function rather ... well ... dysfunctionally. objects lack proper weight, and controls not only fight against you, but appear to have a mind of their own, which means our protagonist ends up doing things like throwing the wrong items from his inventory, or using items at improper times. it's not a problem, ultimately, because item acquisition is not particularly stingy, but it's still baffling to experience as a player.\n<p></p>\nthe oddities &amp; rawness of <i>alone in the dark</i>'s gameplay are insurmountable to most, i will admit, but i do think there are some cool ideas. i really like how experimental devs were during this era regarding physics, and how you interact with the world. it's fun how you maneuver carnaby's body with such intent to light things on fire or attack, and i must admit, i'm a sucker for diegetic menus &amp; things, like how you open up your jacket to access your items, which you see all neatly aligned in your pockets &amp; such. that's fun! that's cool! do i think this game needed to be a barely concieved open world experience? no. but do i think the rest of the gameplay stuff is neat? yeah! sure. i just don't think most of it is well implemented.\n<p></p>\n<i>alone in the dark</i> is a fascinating experience. there's lots of head-scratching stuff in this one, but it's the best of these games that i've seen so far. at least, i find it the most appealing of the bunch. it's bad, don't get me wrong, but ... it's good. you know what i mean?",
    "recommendation": "\n          <b><u>no.</u></b> i don't really wish this gameplay experience on anyone ... BUT. if you have the stomach to endure clunky mechanics with kind of cool ideas, a really hammy story, and the strangest made-for-TV-movie-style presentation i've ever seen in a game ... you might have fun.\n        "

( another staple of the era ... )</p><p>\nthere's things i enjoy about this, though, genuinely. i am a fan of having two separate character routes that give two discrete stories, which reconvene at the end, &amp; i am a fan of how great the background art is. it is excellent seeing how reactive the art is to your flashlight's beam, shifting colors depending on which lightsource you're using &amp; responding to the direction you face. this is an era of game art design that really necessitated creativity, &amp; it results in some really gorgeous stuff.</p><p>\n... but that's about it.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>",

    "review": "this is an interesting game. i feel there are a lot of little details worth talking about here, but the ultimate experience is kind of ... nothing.\n<p></p>\ni think the most attractive thing about this game, to me, is its art direction. particularly the use of colors &amp; camera work to differentiate between the two player characters, as well as what \"world\" those characters reside in, is really nice. warm, pleasant tones for the people of arcadia, presented as a side-scroller, help solidify the idyllic retro aesthetic both within the game as well as for the player; conversely, the cool, clean, sterile colors &amp; environments for the people in \"real life\", as well as the first-person POV, solidify this world as grounded &amp; modern. it's tasteful &amp; cute, as well as being very beautifully executed. this is a fantastic looking game.\n<p></p>\nas well, <i>american arcadia</i> is explicitly, textually critical of corporations &amp; capitalism, and i think in that context, making a product ( the video game ) using an art style that is very reminiscent of the highly saturated, highly contested \"corporate memphis\" style that permeates nearly every real life tech space that the product is criticizing, is fun. it's cheeky! it shows a level of conscious thought going into the visual design that i find engaging. but unfortunately, as excellent as this game looks, it doesn't really ... say anything. by the end of the game, everything feels a bit shallow.\n<p></p>\nwhich was the point, maybe? <i>american arcadia</i> told a very dramatic, hopeful story with a very blunt, cynical ending. it felt like what they were building up to over the course of the game ultimately amounted to nothing, and despite the over-the-top horrors the game presents you, its final message is just, \"shit sucks, and there's nothing you can do about it.\" it is a story interested in being Real -- it indulges in the fantasy of progress &amp; growth, but squashes it at the end in favor of discussing the grim reality of living in our 21-century capitalist nightmare world. and like, of course i sympathize with this view point &amp; the need to express one's frustrations with it through art ... but i don't really think this made a good story, in the end. despite agreeing with the thesis, i didn't like where the narrative went with it, and as a player, i felt kind of let down that all that work i put into engaging with the plot &amp; game was thrown in the mud right as the credits rolled.\n<p></p>\nbut like i said, that empty feeling seems to be the point. in an era of increasing corporate cruelty towards creatives, this almost feels like a personal vent towards that scene: being thought of as cannon fodder by executives who peddle imaginative worlds but have nothing to do with their creations, who treat their artists, animators, writers, designers like they're proverbial cogs in the machine, easily tossed aside &amp; replaced by something more useful, always thinking about an ever-further monetary goalpost -- and as the one who gets tossed, it can feel like there's little you can do to escape the thralls of this machine.\n<p></p>\nbut unlike the workers involved in this scene in real life, <i>american arcadia</i> was not interested in talking about things like unionizing or banding together to make the world a better place, though; it wasn't about conceputalizing a universe where these things can change; it really was truly just about wallowing in the status quo, after dangling the fruits of revolution before you.\n<p></p>\n... oh, and as far as gameplay goes: it's fine. not especially exciting, but gets the job done. it's clear the game's about the story, but it's a pity the story lacked the staying power they wanted it to.",
    "recommendation": "\n          <b><u>not really.</u></b> definitely take a look at some gameplay or borrow a friend's copy to at least check out the cool visuals. i don't really think story &amp; gameplay are worth it, but if \"<i>the truman show</i>, but worse executed\" sounds like your jam, then go right ahead &amp; give it a shot.\n        "

    "review": "we are in a resurgence of retro-style platformers currently, with inspirations coming from both nintendo &amp; playstation titles ( <i>banjo kazooie</i>, <i>spyro</i>, etc. ) and approaches to gameplay varying from highly derivative / loyal to the source material, to things that feel totally different in every aspect but aesthetic. as such, i feel like lovers of the genre have been gifted a gift most niches are seldom gifted: the ability to choose. there's something for everyone out there, it feels like, and i'm sure more is to come on that front as time goes on.\n<p></p>\nso who is <i>corn kidz 64</i> for? <i>super mario 64</i> enjoyers, of course, but i feel like there's enough love &amp; thought put into this game, that anyone who's enjoyed 3D platformers even a little could find joy in it. the animation is spectacular, showcasing the iconic squash &amp; stretch of early 3D mascot platformers with charm &amp; ease; the UI is well integrated into the world, feeling as tangible &amp; alive as any of the characters do, and enhancing the game's silly atmosphere; movement &amp; general mechanics are creative &amp; similarly well integrated, feeling at once both familiar and refreshingly new, while also being relevant to who the player character is ( a unicorn-goat ); and of course, the overall design work -- worldbuilding, level design, character designs, music -- is all very tight. there's even optional challenge levels for people who want to go above &amp; beyond with their gameplay, which all felt pretty satisfying &amp; creative. it's all just so impressive!\n<p></p>\nthe nostalgia in this game isn't to be ignored, either; indeed, it feels like it's central to every single aspect of the game. the lol random XD humor, emo teen protags, and being an N64-style platformer in general are all about reveling in the pleasure of youth ( in the eyes of the 20-30 year olds playing this ). i sometimes felt like the game relied a little <i>too</i> much on this style of humor, but it never got to the point where it felt like nostalgia was the ONLY thing it had going for it -- <i>corn kidz 64</i> is just a good game. as well, the general plot being about living in a dream, and concluding by waking up ( but not showing us back in the real world ) envelopes everything in-universe in a neatly contained little package, where you can go &amp; enjoy the past on a goofy, indulgent adventure, but leave it be once it's enough -- a fun meta-level read on not spending too much time daydreaming of a bygone era? who can say. but i think at the end of the day, the game's main goal was just to be a fun, stylish homage to an era of gaming once left behind.\n<p></p>\nmy main critique here is just that the level design felt somewhat confusing, despite how approachably sized each level was. i think splitting the hub world up into smaller, discrete areas would help with keeping missions &amp; secrets straight in my head ... but it isn't the worst crime to commit re: game design, and i don't think its a deal breaker in the slightest. the humor &amp; general atmosphere might not be for everyone, but i do feel like gameplay would be enough to carry it, if you're reeeeally into 3D platforming.\n<p></p>\n... which i'm not! but i can still see this is a stunning endeavor, and one to be celebrated. <i>corn kidz 64</i> set out to make a good-ass retro 3D-platformer, and it went &amp; did exactly that.",
    "recommendation": "\n          <b><u>yes.</u></b> this is a very thoughtful &amp; faithful recreation of the genre, while still feeling like its own thing enough to not just bank on being a nostalgia trip. this is a fantastic 3D platformer, so if that's a genre you like, i'm sure you'd have fun with this.\n        "

    "review": "i was talking about <i>cult of the lamb</i> with a friend who had recommended this to my partner &amp; i because of its cute artstyle &amp; base-maintenance mechanics, two things we both enjoy. our friend -- a die-hard rogue-like fan -- and us -- folks who hadn't ever really played rogue-likes beyond, well, <i>rogue</i> -- both did not love this game. it's not bad, but it's not good. so if this rogue-like doesn't appeal to those experienced with the genre, nor those who haven't gotten into it yet, then who is this game for?<p>\n\nmy answer is: streamers.</p><p>\n<i>cult of the lamb</i> is a game made for streamers. beyond the ( honestly great ) twitch integration, the game presents itself as a simple, easy, hands-off experience, where you don't need to dedicate too much attention to what's going on in order to proceed. your followers take care of your base for you while you're gone, you kill baddies, you die without much consequence, you head back out, you win. as i said, this isn't a bad game; but when you are not playing this live with a large number of people participating with you, it isn't as fun as it could be.</p><p>\n\nplaying solo results in you having to work harder &amp; grind more to keep up with maintaining your cult, which ultimately ends up disrupting the flow of your outings &amp; makes it feel like you're always on a timer. even if you feed everyone &amp; keep everyone happy, you cannot ever do deep dives into the various dungeons ( presumably where the game gets challenging &amp; fun ), because inevitably your base needs you back home to feed them again; as a contrast with live play, the twitch integration allows for one's chat to manage themselves, so that the streamer can stay out &amp; seamlessly enjoy the bulk of the game.</p><p>\n\nthe simplicity of combat also lends well to streamers, who want to balance between gaming &amp; conversing with their audience. which is a shame, really, because if the dev team had not compromised combat ingenuity or creativity for stylish but ultimately plain battle mechanics, this game might have actually been worth the rest of the hassle.</p><p>\n\nthe art IS cute though, i will admit. and the soundtrack is excellent. i am a renowned sucker for 2d sprites on a 3d background &amp; chill beats! but good art &amp; music isn't enough to sway me when the foundation of the game isn't especially compelling.</p><p>\n\nas a final note -- we played this on the PS4 &amp; it was buggy to the point of breaking our game, several times, resulting in major resets &amp; loss of progress that almost made us drop it entirely. bugs on release is unfortunately to be expected these days, from small &amp; big studios alike, but that doesn't make dealing with it any easier, and for a game that we already weren't super excited about, having to redo a ton of work was the bitter cherry on top of this lukewarm experience.</p><p>\n\nthere are plenty of games out there obviously &amp; explicitly made for streaming ... but <i>cult of the lamb</i> presented itself as a single-player experience that was <i>enhanced</i> by streaming; as expressed here, i feel that they failed in this sentiment, as the \"enhancement\" feels borderline mandatory, rather than purely additive. i feel it's possible to make something like what this team was gunning for, but as it stands, cult of the lamb did not deliver. i am curious to see what sorts of other native-twitch-integration-type works get made after being inspired by this one, though ...</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>",

    "review": "i have watched through every QD game, but this is the first i played myself, so it'll be the first i write about.<p>\n\nmy general opinion on cage's gaming library is that it is racist, sexist, homophobic detritus not worth the crunch he forces his teams to endure. each story presents itself as competent &amp; profound, but when put under any sort of scrutiny, manifests as the exact opposite of this: unrealistic, emotionally charged scenes, viewed in total isolation from the greater fiction they're being told in, will illicit a genuine emotional response from you -- fear, stress, dramatic relief -- but when thinking for even a second about what's going on, you will say to yourself, \"... wait, this is dumb.\" cage's directing has always relied on you not thinking, lest you realize you're being sold the same shit story again, with the same unearned payoffs. it is low effort storytelling, wrapped up &amp; shrouded in a high effort presentation.</p><p>\n\npredictably, i feel no different about <i>detroit: become human</i>. although i do feel like this is the best of QD's technical work to date, it is, at the same time, also their worst work overall.</p><p>\n\nthe game has a genuinely embarrassing lack of self awareness. some examples include:<br>\n</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:square;\">\n<li>the concentrated Sexy Imperiled Woman trope cage can't seem to let go of, which permeates the entirety of kara's route like an airborne disease, rendering her inclusion in the story completely, literally, inarguably pointless;<p></p></li>\n<li>the \"\"\"borrowing\"\"\" of symbols &amp; moments from historic real world oppression, reducing them to props for this utterly uninspired story, like numbers &amp; armbands branding androids as inhuman, a literal concentration camp, or using the US civil rights movement as the game's \"inspirational\" backdrop;<p></p></li>\n<li>a general contempt for players who dare to veer off the path of cage's idealistic tone-deaf vision, ie. \"wrong\" choices lead to nonsensical \"gotcha\" conclusions, rather than logical / thematically appropriate ones;<p></p></li>\n<li>other renewals of old, outdated tropes, like an obsession with cops, evil creepy fat men, twists the audience has absolutely no telegraphing for ...<p></p></li>\n</ul>\ni could go on, but you understand. it just feels like <i>detroit</i> was made to piss as many people off as possible, except for the microscopic audience cage has in mind for every one of his projects ( people who don't want to think ) ( AKA himself ).<p>\n\nbut as much as i complain, there's still some good in this, somehow. i like that there's a model viewer ( more games should let me scope those gorgeous assets like this! ). the user interface is finally readable, easy to follow, &amp; integrated aesthetically into the lore by virtue of all the characters being computers. the short gameplay time ( ~10hr ) makes for decent replayability as well, &amp; there are actually quite a lot of differences in the consequences you'll reap as you play differently; the only problem is, this game has one of the worst stories of all time, so why would you bother wanting to replay? for the allure of schadenfreude? perhaps.</p><p>\n\nthe thing i enjoyed most though, is the character acting &amp; animation. it's great in this title, lots of subtleties &amp; attention to detail. i even found myself genuinely caring about some of the characters because of how tactfully they were portrayed by their team.</p><p>\n\nrelatedly: the most successful of the three routes was connor's ... not because the story was especially good, but because of the relatively focused emphasis on character. while marcus' route put the greater plot of the game at the forefront ( thus weakening his individual story in the process ), connor's route put his feelings &amp; emotional growth at the forefront; it tied his co-star hank into it as well, creating two diametric perspectives that in the end either learned from each other &amp; found peace, or used each other as scapegoats to grow bitter. the benefit of the route focusing on individuals rather than the asinine Oppression Olympics cage was working with ended up really making connor's stories stick out ... but again, i don't actually think these stories were particularly amazing, &amp; i think they're made much worse for existing in the realm of <i>detroit</i>'s narrative. it's just in comparison to the hollow storytelling for the other two protagonists, a story arguably about dawning realization &amp; acceptance -- or suppression &amp; denial -- of one's nature is a sigh of relief &amp; an honest to god surprise for this studio.</p><p>\n\n( as a side note: kara's route is also focused on her character, but that character is Woman = Mother, rather than an actual individual with unique motivations, &amp; it made me feel fucking insane. if the question \"can a robot be a caretaker?\" was actually addressed with any sort of thought -- just like, any, like any at all -- this could have been an interesting route. but this is david freaking cage, after all ... )</p><p>\n\nultimately though, as i said at the beginning of this review, <i>detroit</i> &amp; its predecessors are crap &amp; cage is a merciless hack. i wish he'd never make a game again, &amp; i wish the crew at QD could be released to the wind to go use their skills on projects with actual meaning or purpose beyond being something their director can jerk off to. alas, life is cruel, &amp; cruel people tend to get their way.</p><p>\n\nthere's more to be said, but this review is already too long. there's probably a hundred &amp; one more eloquent, detailed, &amp; better written reviews about this game &amp; the rest of QD's works ... so go seek those out if you want more dirt.</p><p>\n\ni do have one final thought, though: if you make a game where the premise is asking your audience to grapple with the humanity of non-human characters, &amp; in the introduction of your game, you show the audience both 1) that these non-humans are undeniably human, &amp; 2) that anyone who thinks otherwise is a ghoulish villain ... like, why are we still here? what then, is the point of your story?</p><p>\n\n... nothing?</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>",

    "review": "i dipped my toes a bit into this one, but i ultimately don't think it's for me. <i>granblue fantasy: relink</i> is potentially a dream for fans of the franchise, but if i imagine myself in their position, i feel i may be disappointed.\n<p></p>\nbecause <i>granblue</i> started as a gacha game, there are fundamental aspects of its design that i feel do not mesh well with <i>relink</i>'s party-based RPG gameplay.\n<p></p>\nthe first is its massive cast of characters. as a gacha game, the leading ethos manifests as either expanding the character roster significantly more than a standard video game, or expanding costumes, equipment, add-ons, or all of the above, in order to incentivise gambling from the player. as <i>granblue</i> shifts towards a more \"traditional\" style of gameplay with <i>relink</i>, the developers need to consider how to reign in scope without disappointing too many of their core player base -- which of its characters do you include, which do you exclude, what storylines or character arcs do you follow, etc.<br>\nwhile i'm not very familiar with <i>granblue fantasy</i> proper, the time i spent in <i>relink</i> had me thinking they decided on a decent cast for your party ... but, i also couldn't help but notice that when you swap members out from your original starting crew, they don't get any dialogue. no party banter or interaction with the world feels <i>desolate</i> in a party-based RPG like this -- so many of these types of games benefit from <i>characters</i> driving their stories, and i think a genuine downside to <i>relink</i> is that it sacrifices that feeling of getting to know your crew &amp; watching them grow in order to fit as many core characters from the gacha predecessor as was feasible.<br>\nthe main cast still talks with each other, which is great, but why even bother letting me swap out characters if those characters don't actually get involved in what's going on? i know the answer is that <i>granblue</i> isn't that type of story, and the most important thing is being able to move around freely in a 3D space with my already established favorite guy, but again, the RPG genre ends up feeling painfully hollow when it starts being less about character <i>story</i>, and more about character <i>presence</i>.\n<p></p>\nthe second thing that <i>relink</i>'s gacha past affects is its general presentation. the UI is utilitarian &amp; expansive like an MMO's, making the game feel less like a guided adventure &amp; more like i'm doing dailies for 10 minutes; the VFX are too flashy &amp; disruptive, filling the screen with visuals that muddy the field of view &amp; make every battle feel less like you're involved in a fight, and more that you're just mashing buttons &amp; letting things happen; and finally, the main crew character designs feel dissonate from the world they live in or roles they're filling, each trying to be loud &amp; unique without considering how or why these people look the way they do beyond sex appeal &amp; surface-level character concept.<br>\nif you don't mind this style of gameplay, then it isn't a big deal i suppose. but even as someone who enjoys playing MMORPGs, i feel strange playing what is ostensibly a single-player experience that is completely drowning in modern multiplayer aesthetics, and unfortunately, this feeling is enough to turn me off from the game in the end.\n<p></p>\ni don't think <i>relink</i> is poorly design by any means, though. there's a level of polish here that is honestly hard to find, and from what i understand, <i>granblue</i> fans are quite happy with how characters have changed mechanically between the original game &amp; this new version. but my standards are high when it comes to these sorts of adventures, and i can't imagine myself being satisfied if i was being advertised an expansive, involved RPG adaption of my favorite video game <i>granblue fantasy</i>, only to get something that's as narratively mediocre as this.\n<p></p>\ni will say, though -- i adore the portrait art in this series, and i'm very, very happy to see them trying to emulate that style with their 3D models. i think the look of the game is fantastic on that front. ( although, it could always be pushed further. i KNOW they've got the money to experiment &amp; really push the envelope ... so do it, damn it!!! ) but that isn't enough to keep my attention, and so i'm afraid i'll be dropping this one for now.",

    "review": "when i think about this game, i find myself saying, \"oh yeah, this is definitely one of the best QD titles.\" but then i rewatch it ... and it's just like ... what the hell made me say that??\n<p></p>\nthis game is awful. awful in the same way all of cage's games are -- perhaps to a greater degree than normal. the sexism, racism, ableism, cop apologism, etc. are off the charts here ( what with its \"unique\" \"soundtracks\" for its black &amp; female protagonists, or the \"meta\" racist chinese man who runs the library, or the zombified \"patients\" at the \"mental hospital\" ) &amp; the typical poor plot planning &amp; utterly absent telegraphing for basic plot beats &amp; twists is more apparent than ever. gameplay is a mess, quick-time events take five minutes on a perfect run just to get through, but god help you if you fail &amp; have to sit through their pointlessly drawn out trials over &amp; over. it's as incompetent &amp; well funded as always, &amp; as always, i am left with woeful disbelief at the fact that such a thing was allowed to be made.\n<p></p>\nbut ... <i>indigo prophecy</i> has a unique leg up that the other QD titles don't seem to have. and that's its bizarreness. it is entirely because of the aforementioned failure to properly set up its plot that <i>indigo prophecy</i> manages to catch me by surprise every time &amp; leave a lasting impression, one that somehow manages to always override all the crushing negativity that surrounds it. the sudden shift from a quiet occult mystery to a completely off the rails insane magical disaster that this game's plot attempts to present as a cohesive story is nothing less than breathtaking.\n<p></p>\ni think this game gets a pass because the era that it was released in was one where video games were still trying to get their footing regarding prestige storytelling, &amp; thus, narrative creativity &amp; storytelling prowess were still being given more leeway than they maybe deserved. moreso, though, is the emergence of QD's signature gameplay style -- ie. playing as multiple characters, whose lives intertwine with each other &amp; whose goals are in direct conflict -- which impressed &amp; wowed gamers, who were used to a more traditional, single-protag hero-vs-villain type adventure. and to give it credit, this <i>is</i> a cool idea, even today. but it isn't a cool enough idea to elevate this convoluted piece of fiction beyond its greater well of shortcomings, <i>especially</i> when the payoff in this game is to essentially just dump the other deuteragonists you play as in the garbage to make way for the main protagonist's super special hero boy story's finale.\n<p></p>\nand i just have to point out -- unrelated to anything so far -- that in this game, cage has had his team 3D model him, to put him in the video game, so he can do a sexy dance with the single female playable character in her underwear in the unlockable extras section. there's also various references to cage's genius, like a poster in the protag's appartment for \"citizen cage\", or a news article online about the oustanding, jawdropping, genius success of \"omikron: the movie\", directed, in text, by david cage. all very normal, level-headed stuff!\n<p></p>\nanyway ... i don't have much else to say. i hate david cage, he's an arrogant talentless shit for brains; he has a crazy talented art &amp; technical crew who work themselves to death to get cage's jackoff material out to the public; this pretentious story sucks complete ass; i love to hate it.",
    "recommendation": "\n          <b>uh.</b> well. same as my other quantic dream reviews ... if you like watching evil pitiful media for shits &amp; giggles, i'd recommend you check out an LP of this. not sure about playing it yourself, though ... seems kind of agonizing.\n        "

    "recommendation": "\n          <b><u>maybe.</u></b> this was an unsurprisingly letdown for me, and i don't really think i'd recommend it. but if all you're looking for is More Bloodborne, then you'll probably be satisfied with this &amp; thrilled enough by the differences between the two to be happy.\n        "

    "review": "<i>lunacid</i> is not a bad game, by any stretch of the imagination. it's playable &amp; fun enough to mess around in, if you enjoy stride-n-strike style combat &amp; old school dungeon crawling. the music is nice too, if not unusual, and although it did set an unmistakable tone &amp; setting, it sometimes felt unfitting, as if you turned your in-game music off to play your own. there's a level of meta-ness to <i>lunacid</i> that makes that kind of move feel intentional, so it ultimately didn't bother me too much ...\n<p></p>\n... but this leads me into my critique: my main problem with this game isn't that it lacks a vision or is otherwise incompetently executed; it's that i don't think its vision is good.\n<p></p>\non my first playthrough, i feel like i could sense an underlying message being teased here. the inclusion of secret VHS tapes, repetitive dungeon design, the general PSX aesthetics, and the constant references &amp; callbacks to fromsoftware's older titles like <i>kings field</i> or <i>shadow tower</i> all seem to be coming together to say something about nostalgia. but ... what? is the message \"it's time to let it go\"? why? what needs to be let go here? the genre ... ? it just feels like a strange thing to champion, when what you've made essentially amounts to a love letter to the things you're telling others to forget about.\n<p></p>\ni admit, i could be completely off the mark of authorial intent. i understand <i>lunacid</i> has both multiple endings &amp; dozens of hidden secrets, and possibly indulging in all these things would better formulate the game's thesis for me ... but i'll be honest, i just don't care to know. i was not pulled in enough during the hours i spent in this world to want to go through it all again, just to get the full picture.\n<p></p>\nlike ... gameplay / combat is decent enough. i like that your weapons upgrade as you use them, which is incentive to use your favorites regardless of what else you pick up ... but there's also a clear power creep in new weapons, which negates this feature entirely. as well, i don't think the level designs are fun to run through -- some have cool motifs or aesthetics, but they're structurally all just too same-y for me; they feel confusing &amp; oppressive. does that play into ideas of nostalgia? sure. does that make your game fun to play? not really. it's a compromise i would have liked to see pushed in more creative directions, at a minimum for the sake of the player.\n<p></p>\nand speaking of \"creative\" ... i absolutely cannot stand how incessantly referential this game is. \"sheryl the crow\", the scythe-wielding demon girl, the level designs, the world building &amp; lore, the weapons &amp; items, that LONG as HELL cutscene basically straight-up pulled from <i>shadow tower</i> ... it just goes on &amp; on &amp; ON. i am very much a proponent of showing your inspirations &amp; building off of them, but i am <i>also</i> a proponent of being thoughtful with it. when you build your world as <i>lunacid</i> as done -- a cheeky Remember This? Remember That? sort of affair -- its presentation is weakened by the weight of the meta. i'm not thinking about the unique circumstances of this world anymore, i'm thinking about how every other thing in this world is pulled from or obviously nodding to something outside of it ... and it just makes me think, like, why am i playing this game? why don't i just go play <i>those</i> games instead? <i>lunacid</i> has some good ideas, but they are totally eclipsed by their inspirations, and made shallower for it.\n<p></p>\nand like i said earlier -- <i>lunacid</i> is not incompetent. all of these choices feel deliberate. i just don't think they're compelling. it feels like there are so many more creative ways to make a game like this -- a dungeon crawler about nostalgia -- without relying so heavily on the games you want to evoke.",
    "recommendation": "\n          <b><u>sure.</u></b> i don't like this game, but i won't say it's bad. for modern gamers, this kind of experience is difficult to get &amp; has value. if you've been curious about dungeon crawling, but never figured out how to play the old ones, this seems like a good alternative.\n        "

MD's remarkable crew somehow managed to create a flawlessly succinct companion piece to the base game through <i>echoes of the eye</i>; again: mechanically, artistically, thematically, this DLC is a powerhouse in video game storytelling, just like its predecessor, &amp; it exists all at the same time both perfectly within its own world, yet deeply, intrinsically tied to the greater world of the base game.\n<p></p>\nand that's maybe the most important part of this DLC, to me -- how it ties into the pre-established world of <i>outer wilds</i>. the end of the DLC feels almost more significant than the end of the entire game, just from the sheer amount of knowledge &amp; emotion that it hits you with, &amp; how it retroactively colors the base game because of that. as always, this game insists on presenting its bleak story through such a warm, loving lense, but the DLC ... it's a-whole-nother beast. this may be within spoiler territory, but: the DLC tells such a personal, powerful, dramatic story about a people you never knew existed, who did everything they could to hide away &amp; be forgotten until the very end ... but whose influence changed the tragectory of the lives of every creature in your solar system, &amp; even the lives of those beyond it. it's cruel &amp; kind &amp; beautiful.\n<p></p>\ni may like the DLC more than the base game. in fact, i <i>know</i> i do. but it's only this good, because its foundation is good. <i>outer wilds</i> was a perfectly contained gameplay experience, but <i>echoes of the eye</i> exceeded every expectation i had &amp; more. it adds so much color to an already colorful world; it heightens the tragedy &amp; beauty of the base game substantially while existing as its <i>own</i> perfectly contained experience, made all the more perfect by the greater context of the solar system it lives in.\n<p></p>\nand of course, i should mention that the altered gameflow of the DLC is also fantastic. to be as vague as possible, i will say this: pay attention to what you're doing, why you're doing it, &amp; how it differs from progression in <i>outer wilds</i> proper. there is purposeful, thematic significance in these changes.\n<p></p>\n...\n<p></p>\nyou know, these <i>outer wilds</i> reviews are frustrating to write, because i am desperate to reveal as little as possible while also trying to convey <i>why</i> this game works so well. as mentioned in the base game's review: discovery is the key here. this is a mystery-exploration game, &amp; so much so one, that if you boot up a clean copy &amp; know what to do, you can beat the game in 20 minutes, easy. the story it tells holds up regardless of if you know all the mysteries ( this is why i am ravenous for other people's playthroughs! ), but piecing things together yourself, unearthing discoveries, it's all part of the fun. i don't want to take that fun away from anyone ... but i am desperate to get other people to play this.\n<p></p>\nsuch contemplative experiences aren't for everyone -- i understand this. if you are looking for nonstop action, for hyperrealistic graphics, for blood &amp; guts &amp; such, neither <i>outer wilds</i> nor its DLC will have what you're looking for. but the majesty of its story, &amp; the feeling of success it gives its players when they can piece it all together, is nothing short of spectacular; i would hate for this game to be unfailry dismissed because on a surface level, it's not what certain crowds are looking for.\n<p></p>\ngive my friend <i>outer wilds</i> &amp; its DLC a good chance. i would not be this passionate about this, if this was not something i truly believed to be a one-of-a-kind adventure.\n\n    </div>\n<div class=\"dlc-game-rec\">\n<div class=\"dlc-game-rec-q\">so, do i recommend this?</div>\n<div class=\"dlc-game-rec-a\">\n<b>yes.</b> you already knew that though. ;^)\n      </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<div class=\"extras\"> \n<h1>extras</h1>\n<h2>taking a look at the <u>outer wilds</u> alpha</h2>\n<hr>\ncoming soon ...\n</div>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<div class=\"extras\">\n<h1>extras</h1>\n<h2>further discussion</h2>\n<hr>\n    i would like to touch on some specific parts of this game that i loved, particularly how its themes are presented. <i>outer wilds</i> does a great job at setting itself up through precise set pieces, world building, and general asset use, which all tie together to pack a beautiful punch at the end. however ... to do this, i'll have to talk details. so you know what that means ...\n    <p></p>\n<h4><b>please, if you haven't finished the game + DLC, <u>don't read ahead.</u></b></h4>\n    this is a mystery game, and as i mentioned above, discovery is part of its enjoyment. i highly encourage you to experience this yourself, as it is one of my favorite things i've done in a long time.\n    <p></p>\n<div class=\"fav1\">\n<h2>the beginning &amp; the end</h2>\n<h3>the music of timber hearth</h3>\n<hr>\n      all the music in <i>outer wilds</i> is great. each track is both lovely to listen to &amp; enhances the tone tenfold, wherever you go: the frightening ambience of dark bramble, the melancholy of the nomai ruins, the wonder of space flight &amp; exploration ... but there is one track that feels especially noteworthy to me: the music of timber hearth, your home.\n      <p></p>\n      i'm not a music guy -- so excuse the minimal scope of my analysis here -- but timber hearth's theme captures <i>everything</i> about the game to me, so perfectly. it's pleasant &amp; humble, a guitar strumming away at an easy to get into beat, one that inspires adventure, but isn't overdramatic; it evokes the feeling of sunrise, of heading out on a hike somewhere you've never been, to see &amp; experience new things. and indeed, that's just what you &amp; your hearthian avatar do, as you hear it for the first time: you get up at the break of dawn, &amp; you start exploring. it's a great melody to start your game off with.\n      <p></p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/36JtMdp70h0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"400\"></iframe>\n<p></p>\n      ... but it's not just about the start of your adventure. take a listen to the embedded song. pay attention to the way it ends. does it feel like it's ending too soon? or on a bittersweet note, somehow ... ? like all it needed was just a few more bars, &amp; it would be done?\n      <p></p>\n      i didn't think much about this when i first started playing. but as i neared the end of my journey, this cliffnote ending seemed to resonate differently with me, &amp; i realized something: timber hearth's theme reflects the greater themes of the game, starting with the ideas you've learned about the futility of your quest to save the universe. as you play the game, you think you'll be able to solve this cataclysmic disaster, &amp; everything will go back to normal; you can go home &amp; share all you've learned with your friends &amp; family, you can save them, you can carry on as normal ... but in the end, you can't. you'll never go back to normal, &amp; you'll never be able save everyone.\n      <p></p>\n      but in this way, it also reflects the softer side of things: that in the end, things just have to end. no matter what. <i>and it's okay.</i> timber hearth's theme is beautiful, &amp; it is complete -- though it may feel as if there is more to be said, it has said all it needs to, &amp; now, it's time to move on to something else. something new.\n      <p></p>\n      the dissatisfaction of this song evokes such poignant aching in me. the scope of the game's tragedy is massive: it's cosmic, literally; yet this tragedy is somehow presented in its entirety as a microscopic form of itself here, on timber hearth. and it's more personal, being tied to your home turf. it's more gutwrenching as well ... but it's also wonderful.\n      <p></p>\n      and that's what <i>outer wilds</i> is all about, really. the gutwrenching, wonderful tragedy of life. the ever moving flow of time. and the ability to learn how to say goodbye.\n      </div>\n<div class=\"fav1\">\n<h2>contrast &amp;

    "review": "when i first saw screenshots from <i>pentiment</i>, i was immediately drawn to its art style. at one point in my life i had a particular interest in medieval european art, so to see a whole game dedicate itself to that aesthetic was an instant win for me -- i knew whenever i got to play this, i'd love it just by its visuals alone. fortunately for me, though, is that <i>pentiment</i> ended up being <i>so</i> much more than just its looks.\n<p></p>\n<i>pentiment</i> is ... a mystery role-playing game, i suppose. it's a slow-paced, contemplative adventure where you play as an artist living in a small, 16th century alpine town in bavaria. it blends painstaking research of the zeitgeist with modern day language &amp; humor, making the experience both approachable &amp; immersive.\n<p></p>\nthe detailing in its presentation is nothing short of masterful -- font faces &amp; text colors convey intimate detail into a character's beliefs ( and what <i>your</i> character believes of <i>them</i> ); sound design is stark &amp; moody, using music to emphasize tone as tastefully as possible; character designs are varried, memorable, &amp; creative, with even their chosen animation style emphasizing the fact that they're illustrations come to life; even the menuing &amp; gameflow are dedicated to the aesthetic, like you're really turning the pages of <i>pentiment</i>'s tome to watch its story unfold.\n<p></p>\nand to speak on that story a bit here ... i loved it. i won't say too much, but i <i>will</i> say i was very surprised by how toe-to-tip thoughtful it was. the game's themes unfurl &amp; interweve with each other so beautifully, it was absolutely stellar to watch things fall into place. \"pentiment\" comes from the word \"pentimento\", referring to the process of revealing older versions of a painting as its layers get stripped away, be they by human hand or time. this idea -- unearthing a secret by peeling away its surface, bit by bit -- is carried on through the game's art design, its plot, its world-building ( if you can refer to historical fiction that way? ), its everything -- and it's amazing! there is so much passion &amp; love woven into the fabric of <i>pentiment</i>'s narrative tapestry.\n<p></p>\nand my initial hunches about <i>pentiment</i> were right, of course: its aesthetic blew me away. it's been a very long time since i've played a modern game that tried SO hard to dedicate itself to its visuals. it is considered taboo -- in some developer circles -- to prioritize <i>concept design</i> over <i>game design</i>; and in a way, i agree. if your game is too bogged down by high-concept visual language, its going to make most players struggle just to do basic tasks like navigate a menu. an example of this is any of quantic dream's titles, like <i>beyond: two souls</i>, where your user interface is a small white dot ... which is great for conveying you're \"playing\" an \"immersive\" \"movie-game\", but otherwise makes actually seeing what you're doing hard, as well as poorly conveying how you interact with objects once you've targeted them.<br>\ni don't think <i>pentiment</i> is free of these concerns, exactly: when you want to flip through your journal, for example, you have to truly flip through the pages to read, which is time consuming &amp; potentially aggravating if you menu too quickly &amp; need to backtrack. but <i>pentiment</i> has also gone to the effort to make such immersive actions as painless as they can ( like adding tabs to your journal for quicker access to sections ) while still trying to prioritize the physical feeling of doing these actions. i am typically willing to work with a game's mechanics &amp; what it asks you to do, but i can see this slower pace frustrating people who do not want to waste time with \"in-between\" actions like this.\n<p></p>\nthat is my only real critique, though, beyond maybe some oversights in triggering certain dialogue trees, or the subtleness of some of its clues. nothing gamebreaking, of course ( and if i am frank, this is all just nitpicking ) but for something as tightly designed as <i>pentiment</i>, such minor hiccups feel more jarring than in other, more rushed projects.\n<p></p>\nthe role-playing aspect of this game has me sort of wondering about what other flavors of the story i could get if i played through it again ... but truthfully, i don't really feel the need to try. despite having some things i'd want to change, i don't think it is appropriate within the themes of <i>pentiment</i> to try &amp; erase my mistakes. what have i learned from this experience, if not to embrace my past &amp; make the best of what i've got?",
    "recommendation": "\n          <b>yes.</b> if you require action &amp; violence in your video games, this may not be for you, but this is an EXCELLENT game. very meticulously designed, with a great story &amp; loveable characters.\n        "

    "review": "i know i'm always saying this about older platformers, but this game is evil as shit. and it may be the most evil of the lot; although i admit i'm still learning about the intricacies of this generation of platformers ( and older ), i feel confident saying that. the design of this game is just ... cruel.\n<p></p>\nthe two most noteworthy mechanics contributing to said cruelty -- in my opinion -- would be 1) the \"magic pixel\" system, and 2) the save &amp; continue system.\n<p></p>\na fundamental part of progression in <i>rayman</i> is the use of magic pixels: invisible triggers that, upon stepping on them, will activate some sort of event on the map. yes, <i>map</i> -- not in your immediate area, not what's currently on screen, but <i>somewhere</i> on the map. if traversing the world of <i>rayman</i> were more pleasant, this might not be as agonizing as it ends up being ... but unfortunately, levels in this game are <i>hard</i>, brutally so, and having to backtrack a hellish gauntlet of projectiles &amp; precise platforming challenges means that, once you hear the audio cue that you've stepped on one of these magic pixels, you are filled with indescribable dread as you frantically try &amp; imagine where this \"thing\" could have spawned ( and it really can be anything, from new enemies to a mandatory collectible ). rayman himself taking up a substantial amount of screen real estate means you're afforded very little space &amp; time to react to off-screen threats, as well, so if one of these triggers a fast-acting enemy, you might find yourself having to backtrack even FURTHER after you die unceremoniously to their attack.\n<p></p>\nnow. consider this. <i>rayman</i> presents players with 5 continues, after which you get no more, no matter how many lives you accrue. seems generous at a glance, right? given other titles of the era gave you 1 or 2 continues at their starts, that feels like a pretty sweet deal? right? WRONG. your continues become a constant vector for stress when you take into account how difficult progression is, how fragile rayman himself is, and now, how the save system functions: when you save your game, you are saving how many lives AND continues you have at that time, and there are no passwords to easily get right back to where you want to be. so the drama of this then becomes, do you risk saving your game after finally overcoming that hard as hell level, despite having lost dozens of lives &amp; several of your precious continues? or do you reset to your previous save -- wherever that may be -- and try to go through the level(s) again to see if you can come out less scathed, now wiser to the game's tricks? who knows how difficult the following levels will be, after all.<br>\ni will say that i do appreciate the tension of this decision <i>on paper</i>, but given how exhausting <i>rayman</i> is to play, it ends up being kind of a hindrance rather than an exciting part of the overall flow.\n<p></p>\nbut ... like many platformers before it, <i>rayman</i> benefits substantially from memorization &amp; subsequent playthroughs. fixed continues no longer become an issue when you know how to deal with every threat ( and can reliably survive or amount lives as a buffer ), and hunting for magic pixels becomes trivial once you've got all the locations wrote to heart. and there is certainly something to be said about the feeling of growth these sorts of games can afford you -- there is nothing quite like revisiting something that once caused you grief, only to effortlessly navigate through it like a pro. that feels good! but that requires a lot of patience &amp; time, and the speed at which <i>rayman</i> ramps up its difficulty might end up turning more players off than encouraging them to persevere &amp; try again.\n<p></p>\nit's just a deeply unwelcoming game. i don't know how else to describe it. i've never experienced a game as lovingly-yet-hatefully made as this. unless you were a kid when it came out ( and were thus both entrenched in the inherit cruelty of game design back then ) or have a very peculiar approach to playing games now, it just feels like <i>rayman</i> is too threatening to enjoy playing. this game wants you weeping &amp; pounding your fists into the ground. this game wants you dead. this is a zero mercy experience.\n<p></p>\n... and it is kind of good because of that. but ONLY kind of. i do think that overall, <i>rayman</i> is too antagonistic, but like i just said, overcoming challenging can be very fulfilling to some. like, the end of this game is one of the most pitiful conclusions to a video game i've ever seen, almost certainly because the bulk of the game involves so much effort to get through -- so the only point of beating this thing is to have said, \"yeah, that's right. i beat <i>rayman</i>.\"\n<p></p>\nthere's more to be said about the unique gameplay mechanics that give <i>rayman</i> its particular identity as a 2D platformer in the 90's, but i don't really care to discuss those. you can go read contemporary reviews for that. but i will say, here at the end, that this is one of the most beautiful pixel art games i've ever seen from this era. there is a stunning amount of attention to the color palettes, and the charm in its animation is <i>so</i> good. fairly pleasant sound design &amp; music too, but thing that's stuck with me the longest since seeing this was its visual art direction ... and its evilness. of course.",
    "recommendation": "\n          <b><u>maybe.</u></b> <i>rayman</i> is definitely a game that's about the journey. if you don't like that kind of thing, you won't like <i>rayman</i>. but if you like to wrestle with a game &amp; feel insane by the end, this may just be the perfect thing for you.\n        "

    "recommendation": "\n          <b><u>yes.</u></b> as with any game, the perspective you go into it with will determine whether or not you like it. <i>shenmue</i> is an absolute classic for a reason, and i encourage you to experience someone else play it if the gameplay is not to your taste. especially if you care about games as an artform &amp; medium, it feels like this is a title you cannot miss -- you will recognize its influence everywhere once you do.\n        "

    "review": "i'm not going to make a habit of reviewing mods or romhacks, but this one is particularly well made -- as are many current-era romhacks for older games like this -- and it's made me want to chat briefly about romhacks &amp; game development in general.\n<p></p>\nfirstly, of course, i will say that <i>the ultimate trial</i> does indeed live up to its name as \"ultimate\". it's made by a team of people who love not just <i>ocarina of time</i>, but the <i>legend of zelda</i> franchise as a whole, and the game is full of tasteful homages to the goliath these games have become, without needing to rely on the references to make the game enjoyable. at its core, <i>the ultimate trial</i> is just a fun experience on its own, which built itself on top of <i>ocarina of time</i>'s combat system, and then thoughtfully reimagined it to make it fresh &amp; engaging. if you didn't like the original, then you probably still won't like this hack's new &amp; improved version of it, but i think it's a really lovingly made, creative game, that stands to add onto the source material, while not being afraid to be its own thing, all while feeling not too terribly out-of-character for the world.\n<p></p>\ni think you can feel the influence of games like <i>hades</i> on <i>the ultimate trial</i>'s structure, but it feels iterative enough that it's only that: an influence. and again, the crew really had their own ideas here &amp; executed on them exceptionally. barring how i feel about an obsession to adhere to The Lore / The Canon Timeline in fanworks like this, i think the story is presented well &amp; is integrated into the gameplay in a cute way. and if you don't care about the story at all, the gameplay is still fun &amp; bulky enough to be an exciting, entertaining new way to engage with <i>ocarina of time</i>, which is what all romhacks should be in the end, really. it's a good game! ( and the custom textures, models, and environments are incredible. a true feast for the eyes!! )\n<p></p>\nbut here's the main reason i wanted to make this review. projects like this, as well as things like gamejams &amp; doujins, just tickle my brain in such a delightful way. they make me want to make a game unlike any other gameplay experience out there. something about how these games are built on premade &amp; familiar assets, with added custom assets -- music, art, characters, story -- that makes these feel more accessible than the fully polished &amp; published affair of your standard video game; and in being more accessible ( ie. being able to see \"under the hood\", so to speak ) it makes my fingers tingle with the need to get involved. i want to play dolls with premade assets &amp; create my own story! i want to transform established gameplay &amp; flow into something clever &amp; fun! i want to make a game!! you know?\n<p></p>\nromhacks aren't for everyone -- a lot of the time, even i'm uninterested in them. but they represent a facet of game design that is kind of all about love &amp; fun, at its core, and i really, really respect that mentality; even the most trolly, stupid romhacks out there were created from a place of passion, first &amp; foremost. it's kind of the most pure means of Making A Game, to me, and i feel like there are so many people out there who started out modding &amp; making hacks, who went on to make inspiring original games of their own with time. it's about building on the works of previous artists in the most literal sense, growing as an individual artist, and then producing something that helps stir that creative fire in someone else. of course original games can do all these things as well -- but the <i>accessibility</i> of fanworks like this is what makes romhacks so charming &amp; inspirational.\n<p></p>\ni'll admit this may be too personal of a perspective on the matter to be taken seriously -- using premade assets reminds me of being younger &amp; doing things like building profiles on <i>neopets</i>, or editting sprites from things like <i>ragnarok online</i> or <i>pokemon</i> -- but i still feel like it's true, despite all that. these are wonderful expressions of culmulative human creativity, without a need to appeal to corporate ideals or an ever-changing, tumultulous marketplace; these are just about making fun shit, sharing fun shit, and having a good time. i love it.\n<p></p>\n<i>the ultimate trial</i> probably deserves 5 stars for all these reasons &amp; more ... but i really do hate the Single <s>Christian</s> Hylian God lore these games shifted towards in <i>skyward sword</i>, and how crazy people are about Following The New Lore And Rejustifying Old Stories To Fit Into It. sorry!!! i'm petty.",
    "recommendation": "\n          <b><u>yeah!</u></b> if you like rogue-lights &amp; are looking for a new way to play <i>ocarina of time</i>, this really feels like one of the more spectacular options afforded to you at this time. plus, the custom assets in this one are nothing short of gorgeous!\n        "
